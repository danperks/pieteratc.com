# fly.pieter.com ATC Visualizer

A real-time radar display for tracking aircraft positions and telemetry data.

This is a spin-off project, made by me and [Cursor AI](https://cursor.com), that connects to and reads the data from [fly.pieter.com](https://fly.pieter.com), made by [@levelsio](https://twitter.com/levelsio).

I will not be fixing anything, nor will I accept any PRs unless they are very cool.

## Built with Cursor

This whole thing was built in <20 prompts to Cursor's Agent, with Claude 3.7 Sonnet doing the heavy lifting. 

I didn't even touch a line of code manually, nor did I review what it wrote - it one shot every change I asked of it!

Go try [Cursor AI](https://cursor.com) and learn what the fuss is about!
